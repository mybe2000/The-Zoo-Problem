          bear) to as big as eight feet long and more than a thousand pounds
          (the polar bear). They're found throughout North America, South
          America, Europe, and Asia. They have nonretractable claws, short
          tails, and excellent sense of smell.

          The tallest land mammal, with a neck as long as 6 feet, the giraffe is
          also well known for the unique brown and white pattern on its coat
          (“pelage”) and its lengthy eyelashes and legs. Habitat: Giraffes use
          both semi-arid savannah and savannah woodlands in Africa.

          Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and
          jaws for pulling down and killing prey. Their coats are yellow-gold,
          and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to
          reddish-brown to black. The length and color of a lion's mane is
          likely determined by age, genetics and hormones.

          Monkeys use all four limbs—two arms and two legs—to walk and run.
          Their hands and feet are good for grasping tree branches. Monkeys have
          a coat of hair on most of their bodies. Many types have bare areas of
          skin on the face and buttocks.

          Alligators have a long, rounded snout that has upward facing nostrils
          at the end; this allows breathing to occur while the rest of the body
          is underwater. The young have bright yellow stripes on the tail;
          adults have dark stripes on the tail. It's easy to distinguish an
          alligator from a crocodile by the teeth.
